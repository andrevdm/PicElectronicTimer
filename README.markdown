Notes
------
Initial version. This still needs some work before I'll be happy with it. Documentation is also not yet complete.

NB this is the first version of my first embedded-C app (first C code I've written in +12 years) so there is a lot that I would like to improve.

E.g.
 - Using interrupts rather than polling for button presses
 - Cleanup the state machines
 - General refactoring
